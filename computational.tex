\section{Computational Details}
The auger decay widths were calculated with the relativistic FanoADC method
implemented in the relativistic quantum chemical program DIRAC \cite{DIRAC17}.
Dyall's cv4z basis sets \cite{} were augmented with additional xsxpxdxf
basis functions following the Kauffmann-Beyer-Jungen approach \cite{}.\\
The radial wavefunctions of the ions were calculated using GRASP \cite{}.

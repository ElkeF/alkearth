\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusions}

We have presented lower bounds for
decay widths for the Auger process initiated by
ionization from the $(n-1)p$ orbitals of strontium and radium.
Through analysis of results from different Hamiltonians and initial state
eigenvectors as well as radial densities of orbitals involved in the
Auger process, we were able to show the importance of configuration interaction
in this specific case and the effect of spin-orbit coupling on decay widths
of electronic decay processes in general.

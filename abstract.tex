Auger processes are electronic decay processes of energetically low-lying
vacancies. In these processes, the vacancy is filled by an electron of
an energetically higher lying orbital, while another electron is simulataneously
emitted to the continuum.
In low-lying orbitals relativistic effects can not even be neglected for light
elements. At the same time lifetime calculations are computationally expensive.
In this context, we investigate which effect spin-orbit coupling has on Auger
decay widths and aim for a rule of thumb for the relative decay widths of
initial states split by spin-orbit coupling.
We base this rule of thumb on Auger decay widths of Sr$4p^{-1}$ and Ra$6p^{-1}$
obtained by relativistic FanoADC-Stieltjes calculations.
